<!--<p class="STYLE2">Many complex systems in the computer, information, biological, chemical processes,-->
<!--    aeronautical systems, and social sciences can be represented as dynamical systems with nodes-->
<!--    denoting objects and edges denoting relationships between the objects. Such complex network-->
<!--    structures often change continuously over time through the observation of events at irregular-->
<!--    times, such as networks of social interactions between people via messages, networks of-->
<!--    transactions between organizations, and networks of face-to-face interactions between people.-->
<!--    The control and optimization of these real world problems are challenging and practically-->
<!--    importance. Due to the nonlinear nature of the problems, the formulated dynamical systems are-->
<!--    usually highly nonlinear.-->

<!--</center></h2>-->
<!--<p class="STYLE2">In the past few years, networked control systems (NCSs) have been gaining considerable-->
<!--    research interest in response to the rapid spread of communication networks. A great deal of-->
<!--    control and signal processing algorithms are executed through large-scale communication-->
<!--    networks with inherent vulnerability, which have given rise to inevitable network-induced-->
<!--    complexities which, in turn, brings enormous challenges to the performance analysis and-->
<!--    synthesis of networked control systems. Thus, it is of significant importance to analyze the-->
<!--    security performance of NCSs and to design efficient controllers for them.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p class="STYLE2">This session seeks to collect and report recent advances in distributed control and security-->
<!--    Analysis of NCSs. Both theoretical and practical works focusing on this theme would be of high-->
<!--    interests. Particularly welcomed is the latest progress of distributed control, privacy-preserving-->
<!--    algorithms and attack-resilient control in autonomous systems, large-scale systems,-->
<!--    interconnected systems, robotics, industrial mechatronics, transportation and variously broad-->

	<h2><center>Special Session on<br />
<font color="blue">Multi-robot cooperation system</font>
</center></h2>
    <p class="STYLE2">Intelligent control systems describe the discipline where control methods are developed that attempt to imitate significant characteristics of human intelligence, which has been attracting recurring attention in a wide range of areas from theory to application. Over the last decade, a large number of advanced control methodologies, such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, artificial immune networks, swarm particle techniques, etc., have attained successful applications in many fields. In terms of this emerging trend, it is timely important to propose a special session, called "Theory and applications of intelligent systems and advanced control", at ICIST 2017, in order to promote interdisciplinary integration in the area of systems and control.</p>
	<p class="STYLE2">The autonomous robot develops rapidly and gradually penetrates into the fields of agriculture, industry, military and other fields. Because of the limitations of the ability of the individual robot, multi-robot cooperation technology has emerged, which can make up for the shortcomings of the individual robot with the advantage of collaboration. This is one of the most important topics in the field of artificial intelligence and mobile robot research. The collaboration of multi-robot refers to the nature of the cooperation of multiple robots in the completion of some collective activities. Multiple robots can accomplish complex tasks that single robot is difficult to accomplish by coordinating tasks, which can improve the efficiency of robot and enhance the adaptability of robot system, so as to solve more practical problems. The cooperation and coordination of multi-robot is a trend of the development of robot technology, and it is also the result of the urgent requirement of practical application. The research of multi-robot cooperative control technology can provide guidance for the development of multi robot coordination and control system, and is the key research direction in the field of robotics.</p>
	<p class="STYLE2">The main focus to be solved in multi-robot cooperative coordination technology is how to give full play to the abilities of each robot in the multi-robot system. In order to change the environment and tasks, the system can organize all robots to complete the task in a flexible, fast and efficient way. The main problems of the research are: formation control of the multi-robot system, communication between robots, robot perception, cooperative decision-making mechanism, coordination control, machine learning and so on.</p>
	<p class="STYLE2">As mentioned above, more attention should be paid to the research of the multi-robot coordinated control system.</p>

<font color="blue">Multi-Modal Human-Robot Interaction/Collaboration</font>
</center></h2>
    <p class="STYLE2">The objective of this session is to improve the interaction/collaboration between human beings and robots, with the purpose of resolving a great variety of problems in industry and services sectors. Due to the advanced hardware and software technology, human-robot interaction/collaboration technique enables humans to accomplish specific tasks (fire rescue, underwater exploration, etc.), by using intelligent devices or robots in complex unstructured environments. With wide applications in such research field, information exchange between the robots and the user plays one of the major roles in various responsible topics including real-time control, sensor perception and fusion, human activity recognition, smart decision making, etc. to achieve versatile and stable environment interactions. This, however, requires that the intelligent functionalities are appropriately associated with the user behavior and intention. In fact, this session aims to raise awareness facing on the challenges of multimodal interaction and integration, and help researchers to better develop the corresponding hotspot technology, thus enhancing the mechanical device physical interaction performance. This goal will be achieved by bringing together researchers working on the relevant fields and tackling challenges that lay ahead for achieving a natural, safe, efficient and stable human-robot interaction/collaboration with multi-sensory information, and evaluating the underlying concepts and tools while targeting real-world applications, like virtual reality, space telerobotics, industry robot collaboration, etc. It is expected that the contribution of this session may be helpful to the development of human-robot interaction/collaboration technology, as well as the innovation and integration of a variety of advanced technology such as ubiquitous computing and cloud computing. We look forward to your participation, as well as the further synergistic collaborations among researchers working on different areas of human-robot interaction/collaboration to extend views toward required key techniques, like image processing, machine learning, cybernetics, etc.</p>
