glistening resplendently with silver rays. Du Fu, the great poet of the 
Tang Dynasty, 
          praised the scene and wrote the quatrains of "My window frames
 the snow-crowned western mountain scene; My door oft says to 
eastward-going ships "Goodbye!" ".
        Around 2200~2400 meters above sea level of the mountain, China's
 largest and best-equipped large alpine ski resort, snow playground and 
alpine grassland sports playground is located. 
        It also houses China's longest cableway. With the change of 
height, tourists will enjoy green mountains, flowers like brocade, 
        specific red leaves to even the extraordinary sight of sea of 
clouds, following the snow-capped mountain.
